# 11. Props And Reusable Components
- If we create some complex app, eg. blog, we will require display blog in several page, like navbar, category, sidebar, etc
- To resolve this, we can use reuseable component that can simply use a code we have created
- A few way to pass data to BlogList components
  - Redeclare data from home to BlogList components
  - Use props where we pass this data from home components to BlogList components
    - Make BlogList components more reusable
    - Allow still use data in the home components
- Props are a way to pass data from one component or a parent components into a child components
- We can use it, by adding property name on child tag, we can call attributes what we want, eg. `blogs={}`
- Then, we must add parameter `props` in child components to collect value passing from parent components
- And we can destruct variable and use that variable
- But, one more short way we can use to get variable from props 
  - From : `const BlogList = (props) => {(then we require to destruct)}`
  - To : `const BlogList = ({blogs, title}) => {(this way we direct fetch variable)}`
