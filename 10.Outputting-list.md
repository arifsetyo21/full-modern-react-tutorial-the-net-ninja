# 10. Outputting List
- Writing list with hardcode is not the best method, that will consume huge time and will not flexible
- The best way is do looping with map method
- Each root element that we return in looping, must have key property, key property is something that react uses to keep track of each item
- So if any data change at any point if we remove or edit any point we can control it
- We can use map method to loop array eg. `{blogs.map((blog) => (<h2 key={blog.id}> { blog.title } </h2>))}`
- Dont missing to use curly braches or brackets in stricting looping method
