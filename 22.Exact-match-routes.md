# 22. Exact Match Routes
- When we create routes, the routes will matching url that we request to route, if route found and match with request url, react-router-dom will throw the match page that match first
- Error come when we put root route in first, that will always return root page first
- Then we can use `exact` attributes that will return only exact match routes
