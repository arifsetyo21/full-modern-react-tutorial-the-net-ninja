# 7. Click Events
- Events are what we click, tap, press in keyboard etc
- We can configure events by adding onClick, onPress attribute in element that we target
- When we use event, we can call action or function that avaiable
- When we call function in events, we can't call directly, because function will not fire again if we do events
- So we can use anonymous function, that anonymous function can handle this problem
- We can throw events detail with throw a variable `const handleClick = (e) => { console.log(e) }` so we can do special action with event detail
