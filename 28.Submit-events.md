# 28. Submit Events
- When we want to adding blog post that we have write, we need to send the data to the api server
- To send the data we need to collect data from form and then wrap it to already object that can we send
- Then we need action to do this, the name is submit
- In regular, event submit will reload the page, and request again to server, this condition is not we want
- So to prevent this reload, we need to add `.preventDefault()` method after submit
