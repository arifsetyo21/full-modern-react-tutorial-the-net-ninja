# 23. Router Links
- When we create a web app, we mostly using achor tag `<a>` to link from a page to another page
- Then when we click anchor tag, we will request to server for a new page we want
- This proccess is too long, because we will waiting from server to response our request
- To avoid it, `react-router-dom` can intercept the request to server, then we will only request to `react-router-dom` instead to server for improve request speed
- But when we use this feature, we will get some error when we change page to fast because of any process in background still run then we update the page at same time
- To avoid this error, we can cleanup `useEffect`
