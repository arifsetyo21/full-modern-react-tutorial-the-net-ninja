# 17. Fetching Data with useEffect
- In this section, we will fetching json data from json-server
- We fetching data with useEffect hook, so data will fetching in first component rendered
- When we fetching data, data not exactly collected directly, but data will take time to fully transfer 
- However, in BlogList component we use .map method, that will looping array from object or array, when object is null some error will happen, so for fixing this we can use when data still null, we not call the component
