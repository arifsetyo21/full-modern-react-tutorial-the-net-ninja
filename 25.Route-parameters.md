# 25. Route Parameters 
- When we want to lookup for page of list blog, we mostly will direct to url with `/blogs`
- But what url to go when we want to detail blog post page? we need a route parameter that define what we want to go, eg. `/blogs/123` or `/blogs/456`
- We can define that parameter `id` in the routes with `:id`, eg `/blogs/:id`. this params that we can use in the further to get content base on id
- To grab the `:id` parameters value we can use the `useParams()`, we can import from `react-router-dom`, eg. `const { id } = useParams()`
