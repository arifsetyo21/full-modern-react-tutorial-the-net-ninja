# 20. Making a Custom Hook
- When we will start create feature again, we may need again feature that we have created before, eg. fetch blog post in home component
- So, we can create again the feature that we write before
- This way is not efficient for time and code efficiency
- So, we can write again the feature like as we create components, but this creature we can call custom hook
- We can use alias in destruct variable  `const { data: blogs, isPending, error }`
