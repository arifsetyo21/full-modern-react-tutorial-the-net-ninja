# 18. Conditional Loading Message
- When our app is deployed in internet, we can't guaranted is our app can smoothly accessed
- Sometimes when user access our app, when internet access or server is any problem, user will take too long time to complete request to our app
- So we can put information into our app that our app is still processing the request, eg. text loading...
- To handle this case, we can use `useState()` and `useEffect()` and put conditional state in our element
